The exporter host can simply push frames to a thread-safe exporter-specified callback. This will cut down on the code previously required for render loop management. It should also yield substantial performance increases for exporters that haven't finely tuned their multithreaded rendering. The \"pull\" model is still supported, and required for Encore and legacy versions of Premiere Pro and Media Encoder.</p> <p>The new Export Standard Param Suite provides the standard parameters used in many built-in exporters. This can greatly reduce the amount of code needed to manage standard parameters for a typical exporter, and guarantee consistency with built-in exporters.</p> <p>Stereoscopic video is now supported when exporting directly from Premiere Pro. In other words, when exports are queued to run in Adobe Media Encoder, they can not get stereoscopic video.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Currently, stereoscopic exporters must use the \"pull\" model and the new <code>MakeVideoRendererForTimelineWithStreamLabel()</code> to get rendered frames from multiple video streams.</p> <p>Export Param Suite now adds SetParamDescription(), to set tooltip strings for parameters. For the three line Export Summary description in the Export Settings dialog, we've swapped the 2nd and 3rd lines so that the bitrate summary comes after the audio summary. We've renamed the structure to make developers aware of this during a recompile.</p> <p>Adobe Media Encoder now includes a Preset Browser that provides more organization for presets. Make sure your presets take advantage of this organization, and are shown in your desired proper location in the Preset Browser.</p> <p>Exporters can now set events (error, warning, or info) for a specific encode in progress in the Adobe Media Encoder render queue. The existing call in the Error Suite is not sufficient for AME to relate the event to a specific encode. So the new Exporter Utility Suite provides a way for exporters running either in Premiere Pro or Adobe Media Encoder to log events. These events are displayed in the application UI, and are also added to the AME encoding log.</p> <p>Multiple exporters are now supported in a single plugin.

The effect instance knows it's a clone because the PF_InData-&gt;sequence_data is NULL (there is a special case if the effect has Opaque Effect Data - in that case, its render clones will receive <code>PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_RESETUP</code> with a NULL sequence_data pointer). It then calls AcquireOpaqueEffectData().

The plugin unflattens this sequence data. It then calls AcquireOpaqueEffectData(), and if the opaque effect data does not yet exist (i.e. when reopening a saved project), the plugin allocates it, and calls RegisterOpaqueEffectData. It then copies the sequence data to opaque effect data.</p> <p>On <code>SEQUENCE_FLATTEN</code>, the plugin takes the unflattened data, flattens it, and disposes of the un-flat data.</p> <p>When <code>SEQUENCE_SETDOWN</code> is called (it may be called multiple times to dispose of render clones), ReleaseOpaqueEffectData() is called.</p>"},{"location":"gpu-effects-transitions/suites/#instanceid","title":"instanceID","text":"<p>The Opaque Effect Data Suite functions need the instanceID of the effect.

For most filetypes with a single video and a simple audio configuration (mono, stereo, or 5.1), only a single stream is necessary. Multiple streams can be useful for stereoscopic footage, layered file types (like Photoshop PSD files), or clips with complex audio configuration (such as 4 mono audio channels). The following describes the general case of multiple streams. For stereoscopic importers, please refer to the description further down.</p> <p>An importer describes each stream one-by-one during iterative calls to imGetInfo8. In response to each call, the importer describes one stream, and returns imIterateStreams, until it reaches the last stream, and then it returns imBadStreamIndex.

During imGetInfo8, the host passes in the stream index in imFileInfoRec8.streamIdx. If the clip has a second stream, then on index 0 the importer should return imIterateStreams and it will be called again for the second stream. On the second one you return imNoErr, as before. The nice thing is that this works in Premiere Pro CS5.5 and earlier - when two video streams are present, on import, they will just appear as two different project items.</p> <p>Prior to CS6, an importer would need to have a prefs structure and on imGetInfo8 it would need to store the stream index in that structure. With CS6 this is a lot simpler. Now, in the <code>imSourceVideoRec</code> (passed in imGetSourceVideo, and part of the aiFrameRequest for async importers), the host application passes in the currentStreamIndex (in the value formerly</p> <p>known as unused1). This makes it much easier to just check when providing a PPix and differentiate the two streams.</p> <p>Now, obviously, it is not desirable to have two project items. In order to get them merged, an importer needs to label the streams (the logic here is pretty simple, if there are multiple labeled video streams, it will appear as a single project item, and all views on that item will show the first stream). For this there is a new selector: imQueryStreamLabel. The struct passed to the importer has its privateData, prefs data, and the stream index, and the label needs to be passed back in a PrSDKString. If you're not familiar with PrSDKStringSuite, it's fairly obvious how to use. In this case you'll be allocating a string, passing either UTF-8 data, or UTF-16 data.</p> <p>In PrSDKStreamLabel.h we define two labels: kPrSDK_StreamLabelStereoscopicLeft and kPrSDKStreamLabel_Stereoscopic_Right. By convention, we expect Left to be stream 0 and Right to be stream 1. This is purely for consistency - if we have multiple stereo clips from multiple importers, we would want the thumbnails to all be consistent. If we stick to this convention, then the thumbnails will all be Left.</p> <p>To integrate well with other third-parties, we strongly encourage using these labels for stereoscopic importers. However, the entire StreamLabel mechanism is intentionally left quite general. You could use whatever labels you want in your importers and effects, and when you request the video segments you can pass whatever label you would like. If you have other uses for this, we would be interested to hear about them, and we would welcome any bug reports.</p>"},{"location":"importers/getting-started/#project-manager-support","title":"Project Manager Support","text":"<p>The Project Manager in Premiere Pro allows users to archive projects, trim out unused media, or collect all source files to a single location.

To use the importer, choose File &gt; Import, and select an .sdk file. Such files may be created using the SDK Exporter. It supports uncompressed 8-bit RGB with or without alpha, and packed 10-bit YUV (v410), and supports mono, stereo, and 5.1 audio at arbitrary sample rates and 32-bit float. It supports trimming using the Project Manager, Properties and Data Rate Analysis, Unicode filenames, the avoidAudioConform flag, and can read video frames asynchronously. It also features a test harness for multistream audio, which can be turned on by uncommenting the <code>MULTISTREAM_AUDIO_TESTING</code> define in the header.</p> <p>Synth Import</p> <p>This synthetic importer generates 8-bit YUV and RGB, video only. To use it, choose File &gt; New &gt; SDK Synthetic Importer. When the clip is created, it demonstrates a sample settings dialog, which can be displayed again by double-clicking the clip in the Project Panel or Timeline Panel. Every time the settings dialog is displayed, it creates new footage in memory. It creates ten seconds of footage at 24 fps. The video consists of horizontal lines of random colors.</p> <p>SDK Custom Import</p> <p>This custom importer creates a clip similar to the Synth Import sample, but generates it to disk, rather than memory. To use it, choose File &gt; New &gt; SDK Custom Importer. You could also import an existing .sdkc media file from the File &gt; Import dialog. After the sample settings dialog, it optionally displays a background frame from the timeline (useful for titlers).</p> <p>ExportController</p> <p>Adds a new menu item to File &gt; Export &gt; SDK Export Controller. When selected, it displays a simple message box on Windows, takes the DV NTSC widescreen preset, and exports a file to <code>C:\\Windows\\Temp</code> on Windows, or to the Desktop on macOS.</p> <p>SDK Exporter</p> <p>This exporter writes .sdk files. To use it, choose File &gt; Export &gt; Media, and in the Export Settings choose File Type: SDK File. It supports uncompressed 8-bit RGB with or without alpha, and packed 10-bit YUV (v410). It supports mono, stereo, and 5.1 audio at arbitrary sample rates and 32-bit float. It demonstrates custom parameters, including a custom settings button. It also writes marker data to an .html file with the same filename. To write files with v410 compression using 8-bit RGB sources, this sample uses routines to convert the 8-bit RGB data to 32-bit RGB, then to 32-bit YUV, and finally to v410. These same routines may be adapted for transitions, filters, and other plugin types.</p> <p>Transmitter</p> <p>The sample transmit plugin does not output to any hardware, but can be used to step through interactions between the host and plugin in the debugger. To use it, go the the Preferences &gt; Playback, and choose the SDK Transmitter as the Audio Device, and as a Video Device. This transmit plugin provides the basic structure, separating concepts of plugin and instance. For video, it declares support for any pixel format and resolution. For audio, it declares support for 2 channels. It also declares a small latency value for demonstrative purposes. On Windows, there is some basic debug logging. It does not actually provide it's own clock at this time, but on playback it simply pretends to step forward a frame with every frame received. This may result in some bug behavior such as playing back at speeds faster or slower than normal, depending on how fast the host can push frames.</p> <p>SDK_ProcAmp</p> <p>This GPU-accelerated effect demonstrates a simple ProcAmp effect using the After Effects API with the Premiere Pro GPU extensions. The effect is found in the SDK folder of the Video Effects in the Effects Control panel.

Software rendering in Premiere Pro includes 8-bit/32-bit RGB/ YUV software render paths. Software rendering in After Effects includes 8-bit and 32-bit smart rendering.Thanks to Bart Walczak for donating this sample.</p> <p>SDK_CrossDissolve</p> <p>This GPU-accelerated transition demonstrates a simple cross dissolve transition using the After Effects API with the transition extensions. The transition is found in the SDK folder of the Video Transitions in the Effects Control panel. It supports CUDA acceleration.</p> <p>ControlSurface</p> <p>You should see the plugin in the PPro UI in Preferences &gt; Control Surface, when you hit the Add button, as one of the options in the Device Class drop-down next to Mackie and EUCON (currently shows as \"SDK Control Surface Sample\").

This has the advantage of providing settings in the Effect Controls panel, rather than in a modal dialog. Editors can adjust Source Settings for multiple clips this way.

Then in imFileInfoRec8, it should set sourceSettingsMatchName to the match name of the effect to be used for the Source Settings.</p> <p>On the effects side, a new PF Source Settings Suite has been added to PrSDKAESupport.h, for effects using the After Effects API. This is how an effect registers a function to handle the Source Settings command.</p> <p>A source settings effect is used primarily for the parameter UI and management. A source settings effect doesn't provide the actual frames. In fact, the effect isn't even called with PF_Cmd_RENDER. The frames come directly from the importer, which provides frames based on the settings as passed to the importer via prefs data.</p> <p>When a clip is first imported, the effect is called with PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETUP. It should call PerformSourceSettingsCommand() in the Source Settings Suite, to initialize the prefs. This causes the importer to get called with imPerformSourceSettingsCommand, where it can read the file and set the default prefs. param1 of that function is imFileAccessRec8*, and param2 is imSourceSettingsCommandRec*.</p> <p>When the source settings effect parameters are changed, the effect gets called with PF_Cmd_TRANSLATE_PARAMS_TO_PREFS.

In the DPX source settings effect, for example, in PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETUP, it calls PF_SourceSettingsSuite-&gt;PerformSourceSettingsCommand(), which calls through to the importer with the selector imPerformSourceSettingsCommand. Here, the importer opens the media, looks at the header and initializes the prefs based on the media. For</p> <p>DPX, the initial parameters and default prefs are based on the bit depth of the video.

If your transmitter would benefit from on-GPU frames, please let us know.</p> <p>When sent QueryVideoMode, the transmitter is informed about the clip/sequence video attributes by being passed a tmInstance pointer. So, for example, if the transmitter instance is constructed to support a 1920x1080 timeline, it can report that same size back to the host application, so that it will not have to handle any scaling. If, for example, it does handle scaling, and it is constructed to handle a 1440x1080 timeline, it can report 1440x1080 and handle the scaling itself. In this way you can choose a single fixed size depending on the timeline.</p> <p>When video frames are pushed to the transmitter, properties like pixel format may change on a segment-by-segment basis depending on the source footage.

Setting it to <code>kGCVFlag_UseFilePixelAspectRatio</code> will return a PPix stamped with the PAR of the file. Setting it to 0 will return a PPix adjusted to the PAR of the project and stamped accordingly. It scales, but does not stretch the PPix to fit the destination PPix that is passed in. So if the destination PPix is larger than the frame asked for, the frame will maintain its frame aspect ratio, letterboxing or pillarboxing the frame with transparent black. To import a frame at its native dimensions, use getClipVideoBounds, allocate the destination PPix using the dimensions returned, and pass the PPixHand and the dimensions into <code>getClipVideo</code>. If the frame size is not the same as the sequence size, the frame must be positioned in the composite by the plugin. |\n|                      | - <code>clipData</code>: the clipData handle found in

For example, to represent the NTSC standard of 29.97 frames per second, <code>scale</code> / <code>sampleSize = 30000</code> / 1001. To represent the PAL standard of 25 frames per second, 25 / 1.</p> <p>To represent the 24p standard of 23.976, 23976 / 1000, or 24000 / 1001. To represent most other timebases, use <code>sampleSize = 1</code>, and scale is the frame rate (e.g. 15, 24, 30 fps, etc). Another way of thinking about scale and <code>sampleSize</code> is that <code>sampleSize</code> is the duration of a frame of video, and scale is that duration of a second of video.</p> <p><code>value</code> is the time in the timebase given by <code>scale</code> over <code>sampleSize</code>. So, for example, 30 frames with a sampleSize of 1001 have a value of 30030.</p> <p>To convert <code>value</code> to seconds, divide by scale. To convert <code>value</code> to frames, divide by <code>sampleSize</code>.</p> <p>Sometimes, as when handling audio-only media, <code>sampleSize</code> refers to a sample of audio, and <code>sampleSize = 1</code>.
