# Exporters

Exporters are used to export video, audio, and markers in any format. Exporters get individual video frames in a requested pixel format (generally, uncompressed video) and uncompressed audio. The exporter is responsible for any compression of the video and audio data, and wrapping the output in a file format.

Exporters can be used from within Premiere Pro or Adobe Media Encoder. From within Premiere Pro, they are accessed via File > Export > Media. From there, the Export Settings dialog appears. The format chosen in the Format drop-down determines the exporter used, and the exporter provides the parameter settings and summary displayed in the Export Settings dialog.
