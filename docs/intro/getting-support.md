Please read relevant sections of this document and view the included sample code before requesting assistance. Please direct questions regarding installation, configuration, or use of Adobe products to Adobe Technical Support.

Having a solid understanding of digital video concepts is vital to developing plugins. This documentation assumes you understand basic video topics such as resolution, frame rates, field interlacing, pixel aspect ratio, bit depth, timecode, compression, color spaces, etc. You must also understand how your plugin will fit into a user's workflow in Premiere Pro. If you aren't yet familiar with Premiere Pro or video editing concepts, we recommend the Adobe Premiere Pro Classroom in a Book.

Use the Premiere Pro SDK forum to ask questions on the API and general integration.
