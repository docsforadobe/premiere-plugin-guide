# Document Overview

This introduction information is common to all the plugin types.

All developers should read this chapter, and browse through chapters two and three before diving too deep into plugin development.

[Resources](../resources/resources.md#resources-resources) is a short chapter that describes the Premiere Pro-specific resources used by plugins, including the Plug-in Property List (PiPL).

[Universals](../universals/universals.md#universals-universals) documents concepts, data types, and structures used throughout the APIs. It also describes suites and functions used by more than one type of plugin.

[Hardware](../hardware/hardware.md#hardware-hardware) introduces Media Abstraction, used by hardware integrators and software developers to integrate with Premiere and accelerate specific workflows.

This document is designed to be read non-linearly. You can browse through the topics from the bookmarks that appear in the left-hand panel in Acrobat, or the right-hand panel in the Preview application on macOS. A simple search for a well-chosen keyword will also turn up much information on any given topic.
