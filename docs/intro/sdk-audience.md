# SDK Audience

The Premiere Pro Software Development Kit enables developers to create plugins for Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, Media Encoder, Character Animator, and Premiere Elements.

The required development environment for the Premiere Pro SDK for Windows is Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 on Windows 7 or Windows 10 64-bit. When setting up Visual Studio you may need to adjust some installation settings to install the components for compiling 64-bit plugins. On macOS, the minimum environment is Xcode 7.3 on macOS 10.12 or later.

The SDK includes sample projects for these development environments. On Windows, projects can often be updated to more current versions of Microsoft Visual Studio by simply opening the project and approving the automatic conversion. The sample code is written in C++. Other compilers and programming languages are not supported. We cannot assist with platform API programming issues not central to Premiere Pro plugin programming.

If this is your first time developing a Premiere plugin, you can skip [Whats New](whats-new.md).

If you are developing on macOS, see a quickstart video on building a plugin using a similar SDK (on macOS) [here](https://assets.adobe.com/public/08c43fb7-4633-4007-5201-b3b77405d770?scid=social_20180227_75678337), and then go directly to [Where Do I Start](where-do-i-start.md).
