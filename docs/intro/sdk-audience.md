# SDK Audience

The Premiere Pro Software Development Kit enables developers to create plugins for Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, Media Encoder, Character Animator, and Premiere Elements.

The required development environment for Windows is Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 LTSC 17.12.

On macOS, the minimum environment is XCode 16.2 on macOS 15.7.1 or later.

The SDK includes sample projects for these development environments. While the APIs in use are C compatible, the sample code is written in C++. Other compilers, build configurations, and programming languages are all 100% NOT supported.
