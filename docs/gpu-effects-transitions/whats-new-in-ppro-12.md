What's New in Premiere Pro 12.0?
################################################################################

GPU effects and transitions built using this SDK can now be compatible with After Effects 15.0 and later. The sample GPU effect projects have been updated so that they load in both Premiere Pro and After Effects.

The newly provided PrGPU SDK macros and device functions allow you to write kernels that will compile on multiple GPU compute languages - OpenCL, CUDA, and Metal.
