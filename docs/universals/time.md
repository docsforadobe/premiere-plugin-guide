Time
################################################################################

There are two different representations of time: ``scale over sampleSize``, and ``ticks``.

----

scale over sampleSize
================================================================================

The first representation of time uses value/scale/``sampleSize`` components, either separated, or combined in a TDB_TimeRecord structure. scale over ``sampleSize`` defines the timebase. For example, to represent the NTSC standard of 29.97 frames per second, ``scale`` / ``sampleSize = 30000`` / 1001. To represent the PAL standard of 25 frames per second, 25 / 1.

To represent the 24p standard of 23.976, 23976 / 1000, or 24000 / 1001. To represent most other timebases, use ``sampleSize = 1``, and scale is the frame rate (e.g. 15, 24, 30 fps, etc). Another way of thinking about scale and ``sampleSize`` is that ``sampleSize`` is the duration of a frame of video, and scale is that duration of a second of video.

``value`` is the time in the timebase given by ``scale`` over ``sampleSize``. So, for example, 30 frames with a sampleSize of 1001 have a value of 30030.

To convert ``value`` to seconds, divide by scale. To convert ``value`` to frames, divide by ``sampleSize``.

Sometimes, as when handling audio-only media, ``sampleSize`` refers to a sample of audio, and ``sampleSize = 1``. In this case, scale is the audio sampling rate (22050, 32000, 44100, 48000 Hz, etc).

PrTime
================================================================================

Most newer areas of the API use a tick-based time value that is stored in a signed 64-bit integer. Variables that use this new format are of type PrTime. When a frame rate is represented as a PrTime, the frame rate is the number of ticks in a frame duration.

The current number of ticks per second must be retrieved using the callback in the :ref:`universals/sweetpea-suites.time-suite`. This rate is guaranteed to be constant for the duration of the application's run-time.
