# Fields

There are different constants defined for fields. These constants are now largely interchangable in CS4, since the conflicting constants for the old compiler API have been removed.

`prFieldsNone`

`prFieldsUpperFirst`

`prFieldsLowerFirst`

`prFieldsUnknown`

`prFieldsAny`

`prFieldsInvalid`
