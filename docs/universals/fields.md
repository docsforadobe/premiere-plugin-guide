# Fields

There are different constants defined for fields. These constants are now largely interchangable in CS4, since the conflicting constants for the old compiler API have been removed.

| -------------------------------------------- |
| `prFieldsNone`                               |
| `prFieldsUpperFirst`                         |
| `prFieldsLowerFirst`                         |
| `prFieldsUnknown`                            |
| `prFieldsAny`                                |
| `prFieldsInvalid`                            |
