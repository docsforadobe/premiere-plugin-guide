# Basic Types Structures

These types and structures are defined in PrSDKTypes.h and PrSDKStructs.h, and are used throughout the Premiere API.

Premiere defines cross-platform types for convenience when developing plugins for both Windows and MacOS.

|  Name | Description  |
|-|-|
| `prColor`                        | An unsigned 32-bit integer that stores an RGB color. This type is useful for the 8-bpc colors retrieved by the color picker in a video effect or transition. Color channels are stored as BGRA, in order of increasing memory address from left to right.|
| `prWnd`                          | A Windows `HWND` or MacOS `NSView*`      |
| `prParentWnd`                    | A Windows `HWND` or MacOS `NSWindow*`        |
| `prOffscreen`                    | A Windows `HDC`|
| `prRect`                         | A Windows `RECT` or MacOS `Rect`.|
|                                  | Use the utility function `prSetRect` to set the dimensions of a `prRect` struct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                                  | This should be used because MacOS `Rect` members have a different ordering than Windows `RECT` members.    |

| `prPoint`, `LongPoint`           | `LongPoint` is deprecated, but still used for a couple of Bottleneck callbacks.  |
