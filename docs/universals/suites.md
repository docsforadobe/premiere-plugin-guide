# Suites

There are different sets of function suites available to Premiere plugins. [SweetPea Suites](sweetpea-suites.md) are the more modern suites that have been added for most new functionality. The [piSuites](legacy-callback-suites.md#pisuites) are still needed for various functionality that has not all been superceded by [SweetPea Suites](sweetpea-suites.md).

Whenever possible, use [SweetPea Suites](sweetpea-suites.md).

There are also function suites more specific to certain plugin types. The [Bottleneck Functions](legacy-callback-suites.md#bottleneck-functions) are useful for transitions and video filters. Other suites available to only one plugin type are documented in the appropriate chapter for that plugin type.
