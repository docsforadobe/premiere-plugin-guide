Suites
################################################################################

There are different sets of function suites available to Premiere plug-ins. :ref:`universals/sweetpea-suites` are the more modern suites that have been added for most new functionality. The :ref:`universals/legacy-callback-suites.piSuites` are still needed for various functionality that has not all been superceded by :ref:`universals/sweetpea-suites`.

Whenever possible, use :ref:`universals/sweetpea-suites`.

There are also function suites more specific to certain plug-in types. The :ref:`universals/legacy-callback-suites.bottleneck-functions` are useful for transitions and video filters. Other suites available to only one plug-in type are documented in the appropriate chapter for that plug-in type.
