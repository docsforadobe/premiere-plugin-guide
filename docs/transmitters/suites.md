Playmod Audio Suite
================================================================================

This suite is used to play audio during playback. There are many more functions that were used by players, still documented in the players chapter. Here we will only consider the single call in the suite that is relevant to transmitters.

Host-Based, or Plug-in Based Audio?
********************************************************************************

A transmitter has two choices for playing audio: it can ask the host to play the audio through the audio device selected by the user, or it can get audio buffers from the host and handle its own playback of audio.

GetNextAudioBuffer
********************************************************************************

Retrieves from the host the next contiguous requested number of audio sample frames, specified in inNumSampleFrames, in inInBuffers as arrays of uninterleaved floats.

The plugin must manage the memory allocation of inInBuffers, which must point to n buffers of floating point values of length inNumSampleFrames, where n is the number of channels. This call is only available if InitPluginAudio was used.

Returns:

- ``suiteError_NoError``,
- ``suiteError_PlayModuleAudioNotInitialized``, or
- ``suiteError_PlayModuleAudioNotStarted``

Transmit Invocation Suite
================================================================================

This suite can be used by other types of plugins to push frames to transmitters.

For example, an effect or titler with a modal setup dialog could push frames to the output.
