Hardware Integration Components
################################################################################

Importers
================================================================================

Importers are used whenever frames of video or audio from a clip are needed. To give Premiere Pro the ability to read media that uses a new format or codec, develop an importer. See :ref:`importers/importers` for more information.

----

Recorders
================================================================================

Users may choose a recorder in Project > Project Settings > General > Capture Format. Recorders are used to grab frames from a hardware source and write them to a file, to be imported for editing. See :ref:`recorders/recorders` for more information.

----

Exporters
================================================================================

Exporters are used whenever Premiere Pro renders preview files, or performs an export on a clip or sequence. To give Premiere Pro the ability to write media that uses a new format or codec, develop an exporter. The exporter used to render preview files in the timeline is set in Sequence > Sequence Settings > Preview File Format. The exporter used for exports is chosen when the user selects File > Export > Media > File Type. See :ref:`exporters/exporters` for more information.

----

Transmitters
================================================================================

A transmitter handles the display of video on any external A/V hardware and secondary output. To give Premiere Pro the ability to play video out to hardware for preview and final playout, write a transmitter. See :ref:`transmitters/transmitters` for more information.
